# BookDBProj
Work in progress....

This is the beginning of the planning phase of the "Lady's Library" software project.

#REQUIREMENTS#

1. Basic query functionality using pre built commands with Postgres W/ Python
    -Users should be able to search by
        -authors
        -series
        -title

    -admin priv can also
        -add
        -remove

2. Firmly decided on 2 tables
    books
    authors

    a potential 3rd table for genres but it may just be simpler to factor it into books as a column
